    <div class="parallax"><h1>From long lines to remote airstrips; the TSA dilemma</h1></div>
    
   
    <p>by Carson Calderwood | date 12/4/2024</p>

    <p>Have you ever arrived at the airport two hours early just to spend an hour and a half waiting to get through security? 
         TSA regulations have become more and more inconvenient, and are causing delays for travelers. TSA has been around ever 
         since 2001 and  has had the same procedures for over 20 years. The outdated procedures are becoming less beneficial 
         and more of a hassle for common flyers.  This problem is also affecting the general aviation community. The biggest 
         threat to our travel rights right now is a bill being proposed that, if passed, will enforce the same TSA restriction 
         on small general aviation aircraft that the large airlines are required to comply with.  Instead, we should try to 
         improve the screening procedures in large airports to be faster, more accurate, and overall improve our experiences 
         at airports.  Because TSA is still a fairly new agency, the ability to improve and change certain aspects is 
         hypothetically very easy.  
    </p>
    
    
    <p>While TSA has recently increased security, these procedures are no longer a minor inconvenience but a growing problem. 
        The current procedures are slow and oftentimes ineffective. There are a few new procedures that not many people know 
        about that can help to eliminate some of the airport hassle. Next time you fly, consider using TSA precheck.  TSA 
        precheck consists of a combination of an online application and an in-person verification of personal information. 
        If you do this you will be viewed as much less of a threat, making it quicker for you to get through TSA and making 
        TSA workers jobs a lot easier. </p>
    
    <p>While speaking about threats, let's talk about general aviation. General aviation is a combination of smaller aircraft 
        like personal aircraft, business flights, or any kind of flight not scheduled, like airlines or military flights are. 
        One of the biggest general aviation communities in the US is the community in Alaska. Many remote Alaskan communities 
        rely on aviation to maintain their economic balance.  The need for general aviation in these communities is best 
        illustrated when you look at the size and geography of Alaska. We all know the saying everything is bigger in Texas 
        but Texas isn't even the biggest state in the US, the biggest state is Alaska.  On top of the size, Alaska is the 
        third least populated state in the US. If you think about the population density of Alaska, you can imagine that with 
        people being so spread apart they need some type of quick transportation in between long distances.  Therefore many 
        people have turned to general aviation for their daily commute. Many politicians want to increase TSA security in 
        general aviation and require that general aviation aircraft follow similar security measures to commercial aircraft. 
        If these politicians get their way, the general aviation community in Alaska could crumble.</p>

    <p>In an article by Rob Stapelton titled <i>Delegation Hopes TSA Backs Down on Strict Aviation Security Rules,</i> he says 
        “General aviation is low on the list of threats to national security” I think this quote speaks to the fact that general 
        aviation should not be as big of a focus point for TSA.</p>

    <p>While TSA continues to provide round the clock protection it is necessary that we maintain a balance of safety and 
        efficiency throughout all forms of air travel.  TSA was created on November 18, 2001 after the attacks of 9/11 as a 
        means of protecting American citizens. Over all TSA has been a success and has protected the American skies, however 
        the procedures taken are impacting common travelers. Next time you fly, try TSA precheck. Or better yet take action and 
        contact your local aviation security representatives and urge them to support updating security procedures.  With the 
        proper changes, air transportation can become faster, safer and much more convenient for everybody.  Together we can shape 
        a more efficient airport experience for future travelers.</p>
